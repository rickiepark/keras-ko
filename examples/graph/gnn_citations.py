## Introduction

Many datasets in various machine learning (ML) applications have structural relationships
between their entities, which can be represented as graphs. Such application includes
social and communication networks analysis, traffic prediction, and fraud detection.
[Graph representation Learning](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/)
aims to build and train models for graph datasets to be used for a variety of ML tasks.

This example demonstrate a simple implementation of a [Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00596.pdf)
(GNN) model. The model is used for a node prediction task on the [Cora dataset](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA)
to predict the subject of a paper given its words and citations network.

Note that, **we implement a Graph Convolution Layer from scratch** to provide better
understanding of how they work. However, there is a number of specialized TensorFlow-based
libraries that provide rich GNN APIs, such as [Spectral](https://graphneural.network/),
[StellarGraph](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html), and
[GraphNets](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets).

## Prepare the Dataset

The Cora dataset consists of 2,708 scientific papers classified into one of seven classes.

### Download the dataset

The dataset has two tap-separated files: `cora.cites` and `cora.content`.

1. The `cora.cites` includes the citation records with two columns:
`cited_paper_id` (target) and `citing_paper_id` (source).
2. The `cora.content` includes the paper content records with 1,435 columns:
`paper_id`, `subject`, and 1,433 binary features.

## Build a Graph Neural Network Model

### Prepare the data for the graph model

Preparing and loading the graphs data into the model for training is the most challenging
part in GNN models, which is addressed in different ways by the specialised libraries.
In this example, we show a simple approach for preparing and using graph data that is suitable
if your dataset consists of a single graph that fits entirely in memory.

The graph data is represented by the `graph_info` tuple, which consists of the following
three elements:

1. `node_features`: This is a `[num_nodes, num_features]` NumPy array that includes the
node features. In this dataset, the nodes are the papers, and the `node_features` are the
word-presence binary vectors of each paper.
2. `edges`:  This is `[num_edges, num_edges]` NumPy array representing a sparse
[adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix#:~:text=In%20graph%20theory%20and%20computer,with%20zeros%20on%20its%20diagonal.)
of the links between the nodes. In this example, the links are the citations between the papers.
3. `edge_weights` (optional): This is a `[num_edges]` NumPy array that includes the edge weights, which *quantify*
the relationships between nodes in the graph. In this example, there are no weights for the paper citations.
"""

# Create an edges array (sparse adjacency matrix) of shape [2, num_edges].
edges = citations[["source", "target"]].to_numpy().T
# Create an edge weights array of ones.
edge_weights = tf.ones(shape=edges.shape[1])
# Create a node features array of shape [num_nodes, num_features].
node_features = tf.cast(
    papers.sort_values("paper_id")[feature_names].to_numpy(), dtype=tf.dtypes.float32
)
# Create graph info tuple with node_features, edges, and edge_weights.
graph_info = (node_features, edges, edge_weights)

print("Edges shape:", edges.shape)
print("Nodes shape:", node_features.shape)

"""
### Implement a graph convolution layer

We implement a graph convolution module as a [Keras Layer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Layer?version=nightly).
Our `GraphConvLayer` performs the following steps:

1. **Prepare**: The input node representations are processed using a FFN to produce a *message*. You can simplify
the processing by only applying linear transformation to the representations.
2. **Aggregate**: The messages of the neighbours of each node are aggregated with
respect to the `edge_weights` using a *permutation invariant* pooling operation, such as *sum*, *mean*, and *max*,
to prepare a single aggregated message for each node. See, for example, [tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/unsorted_segment_sum)
APIs used to aggregate neighbour messages.
3. **Update**: The `node_repesentations` and `aggregated_messages`—both of shape `[num_nodes, representation_dim]`—
are combined and processed to produce the new state of the node representations (node embeddings).
If `combination_type` is `gru`, the `node_repesentations` and `aggregated_messages` are stacked to create a sequence,
then processed by a GRU layer. Otherwise, the `node_repesentations` and `aggregated_messages` are added
or concatenated, then processed using a FFN.


The technique implemented use ideas from [Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907),
[GraphSage](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216), [Graph Isomorphism Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826),
[Simple Graph Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07153), and

### Implement a graph neural network node classifier

The GNN classification model follows the [Design Space for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08843) approach,
as follows:

1. Apply preprocessing using FFN to the node features to generate initial node representations.
2. Apply one or more graph convolutional layer, with skip connections,  to the node representation
to produce node embeddings.
3. Apply post-processing using FFN to the node embeddings to generat the final node embeddings.
4. Feed the node embeddings in a Softmax layer to predict the node class.

Each graph convolutional layer added captures information from a further level of neighbours.
However, adding many graph convolutional layer can cause oversmoothing, where the model
produces similar embeddings for all the nodes.

Note that the `graph_info` passed to the constructor of the Keras model, and used as a *property*
of the Keras model object, rather than input data for training or prediction.
The model will accept a **batch** of `node_indices`, which are used to lookup the
node features and neighbours from the `graph_info`.
